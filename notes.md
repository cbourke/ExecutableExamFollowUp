  maybe expand on specific technologies: text editor, IDE, compiler, linter, dynamic analysis tools (valgrind, debugger)
 AI allowance levels:
   -none
   -filtered AI (codeapp, cs50 integrated)
   -unfiltered
 Distinction between AI usage:
   -How do I do X (guideance, likely least allowed)
   -What does X mean (X= term or compiler message)
   -What is wrong with X (troubleshooting)
